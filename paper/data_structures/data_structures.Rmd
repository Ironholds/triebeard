abstract: >
  The R programming language is built around implementations of data structures common in computer science,
  such as linked lists (R's 'lists') and vectors, as well as R-specific structures such as data.frames. There are
  many more common structures, however, that R does not implement. There are many algorithmic problems that these
  structures are particularly efficient at solving.
  
  Through R's package infrastructure, data structures such as hash tables, stacks and deques have been incorporated
  into the language. In this paper we introduce the ring, triebeard and decker packages, which provide stacks, deques,
  ring buffers and radix trees in R, and explore both how they work and how they compare to existing
  implementations where applicable.

# Introduction

This template demonstrates some of the basic latex you'll need to know to create a JSS article.

# Background

## Data structures

## R's data structures

## Expansions

Don't use markdown, instead use the more precise latex commands:

* \proglang{Java}
* \pkg{plyr}
* \code{print("abc")}

# New structures

## Deques

## Stacks

## Radix trees

## Rings

Can be inserted in regular R markdown blocks.

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x
```
