# Radix trees for Rcpp

This package provides an implementation of radix trees, or [tries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie), for Rcpp development.

It'll provide an implementation for R as well, just as soon as I can start getting external pointers to behave. Very much a WIP (the underlying code works, but still
needs vignetting + CRANning).
