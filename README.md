###Description

Tries, or [radix trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree), are key-value data structures optimised for very, very fast matching of the keys against user-provided data (and then the return of the associated values!)

This is pretty useful in data cleaning and value extraction, and tries let you do it *really* efficiently. `triebeard` contains
an implementation that can be used both when writing R, and when writing Rcpp (and imported and linked against, to boot). For more information see:
